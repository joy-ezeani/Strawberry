   <h1> Cultivation</h1>
   <div class="cultivation-div">

    <p>Strawberry cultivars vary widely in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant.[7] On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.[11] Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially in the relative development of their sexual organs. In most cases, the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.[12]</p>
    
      <p>For purposes of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows one of two general models—annual plasticulture,[13] or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds.[14] Greenhouses produce a small amount of strawberries during the off season.[15]</p>
    
      <p>The bulk of modern commercial production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, fumigated, and covered with plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, to encourage the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. After harvesting, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground.[13][16] Strawberry plants produce more and better fruit when they are young. After a year or two, they decline. Replacing them annually improves yields and enables denser planting.[13][16] However, this necessitates a longer growing season, for the plants to establish themselves. It also costs more to annually purchase plants, form new mounds, and cover them with (new) plastic.[16]</p>
    
      <p> The other major method retains plants for multiple years. This is most common in colder climates. The plants are grown in rows or on mounds.[13][14] This method requires lower investment and lower maintenance, overall.[14] Yields are typically lower than in plasticulture.[14]</p>
    
      <p>Another method uses a compost sock. Plants grown in compost socks have been shown to produce significantly more flavonoids, anthocyanins, fructose, glucose, sucrose, malic acid, and citric acid than fruit produced in the black plastic mulch or matted row systems.[17] Similar results in an earlier study conducted by USDA confirms how compost plays a role in the bioactive qualities of two strawberry cultivars.[18]</p>
    
      <p>Strawberries may also be propagated by seed, though this is primarily a hobby activity, and is not widely practiced commercially. A few seed-propagated cultivars have been developed for home use, and research into growing from seed commercially is ongoing.[19] Seeds (achenes) are acquired either via commercial seed suppliers, or by collecting and saving them from the fruit.</p>
    
      <p> Strawberries can also be grown indoors in strawberry pots.[20] Strawberries won't grow indoors in winter unless aided by a combination of blue and red LED lights.[21] In southern lands, such as Florida, winter is the natural growing season and harvesting begins in mid-November.[9]</p>
    
      <p> The Kashubian strawberry (Truskawka kaszubska or Kaszëbskô malëna)[22] is the first Polish fruit to be given commercial protection under EU law. It is produced in Kartuzy, Kościerzyna and Bytów counties and in the municipalities of Przywidz, Wejherowo, Luzino, Szemud, Linia, Łęczyce and Cewice in Kashubia. Only the following varieties may be sold as kaszëbskô malëna: Senga Sengana, Elsanta, Honeoye that have been graded as Extra or Class I.[citation needed]</p>

    <h2>Manuring and harvesting</h2>
    <p>Most strawberry plants are now fed with artificial fertilizers, both before and after harvesting, and often before planting in plasticulture.[23]</p>
    
    <p>o maintain top quality, berries are harvested at least every other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least half an inch of stem left. Strawberries need to remain on the plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease problems. The berries do not get washed until just before consumption.[24]</p>

    Strawberries are usually picked and placed in shallow boxes in the field.
    Soil test information and plant analysis results are used to determine fertility practices. Nitrogen fertilizer is needed at the beginning of every planting year. There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields. To provide more organic matter, a cover crop of wheat or rye is planted in the winter before planting the strawberries. Strawberries prefer a pH from 5.5 to 6.5, so lime is usually not applied.</p>[25]
    
    <p>The harvesting and cleaning process has not changed substantially over time. The delicate strawberries are still harvested by hand.[26] Grading and packing often occurs in the field, rather than in a processing facility.[26] In large operations, strawberries are cleaned by means of water streams and shaking conveyor belts.</p>
