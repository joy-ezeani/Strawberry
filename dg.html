<p>Pollen grains of strawberry
Strawberries are often grouped according to their flowering habit.[7][8] Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between "June-bearing" strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and "ever-bearing" strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season.[8] One plant throughout a season may produce 50 to 60 times or roughly once every three days.[9]</p> 


<p>Research published in 2001 showed that strawberries actually occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral. These refer to the day-length sensitivity of the plant and the type of photoperiod that induces flower formation. Day-neutral cultivars produce flowers regardless of the photoperiod</p>
